Teradata QueryGrid
******************

Teradata provides low latency high performing connectors that
support high concurrency and parallel processing between Teradata
and Presto. 

The Teradata-To-Presto QueryGrid connector can initiate a query from
Teradata to reach out to Presto. The :doc:`Presto-To-Teradata
QueryGrid connector <connector/teradata>` can initiate a query from
Presto to reach out to Teradata. The connectors are architected to be
as efficient as possible, leveraging SQL pushdown, column pruning,
auto data conversion, and compression as well as optimized CPU usage.
