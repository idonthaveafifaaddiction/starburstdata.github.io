AWS Glue Support
================

AWS Glue is a supported metadata catalog for Presto. It is intended to be used as a alternative to the Hive Metastore with the Presto Hive plugin to work with your S3 data.

AWS Glue with Starburst Presto AMI
----------------------------------

When you deploy a Starburst Presto AMI from the AWS Marketplace, you need to configure the Hive connector to use Glue. The minimal setup is to do the following on all Presto nodes:

1. create a ``/etc/presto/catalogs/glue.properties`` file with at least the contents below::

    connector.name=hive-hadoop2
    hive.metastore = glue

You should add all other Hive Connector specific properties for your use case. See :doc:`/connector/hive` and :doc:`/connector/hive-security` for more details.

2. restart Presto with::

    sudo service presto restart

AWS Glue with Starburst Presto CloudFormation Template
------------------------------------------------------

When using the Starburst CloudFormation template in AWS, you can leverage Glue by simply choosing ``AWS Glue Data
Catalog`` in ``MetastoreType`` field of the Stack creation form (``Presto Configuration`` section)


Starburst Presto with AWS Glue usage
------------------------------------

When configured as above, the Glue catalog will be available as the ``hive`` connector from within Presto CLI or any other Presto connection.
As usual remember to specify the location of the data on S3. Either for the entire schema or on the table level. For example to create a schema ``foo`` in Glue, with the S3 base directory (root folder for per table subdirectories) pointing to the root of ``my-bucket`` S3 bucket, you would write::

    CREATE SCHEMA hive.foo
    WITH (location = 's3://my-bucket/')

You can also create and edit the schema and tables directly from AWS Glue. In AWS Glue terminology the schema is called “database”.

Starburst Presto with AWS Glue prerequisites
--------------------------------------------

Both the AMI and CloudFormation approach mentioned above require the Presto instances to have permissions to access both S3 and Glue AWS services.

**When using Starburst Presto via our CloudFormation template by default you do not need to provide anything, the template will create all necessary resources automatically.**

If however you need to provide your own IAM Instance Profile for the Presto instances (``IamInstanceProfile`` field in the Stack creation form) please consult the :ref:`aws_security_prereq_nodes` section.
Same applies when launching the AMI manually, make sure you choose an IAM Role that satisfies the requirements.

Table and column statistics support
-----------------------------------

With `hive.metastore.glue.column-statistics-enabled` set to `true` (default) table and column statistics will be collected for Glue tables and partitions.
Such statistics are stored in JSON format as Glue table and partition parameters. See also :doc:`/sql/analyze`.


Known limitations of AWS Glue support
-------------------------------------

There are a couple Presto features that are not yet supported with the Glue catalog:

* When column is renamed its statistics are not preserved. Therefore the table needs to be reanalyzed.
* Renaming tables from within AWS Glue is not supported.
* Partition values containing quotes and apostrophes are not supported (for example, ``PARTITION (owner="Doe's"``).
* Using :ref:`Hive authorization<hive-security-auth>` is not supported.
