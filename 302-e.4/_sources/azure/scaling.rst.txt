Scaling a Running Presto Cluster
================================

Azure HDInsight provides a `scaling <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal#scale-clusters>`_ feature that allows you to change the number of worker nodes without having to re-create a new HDInsight cluster. This allows you to scale up and down the cluster based on demand saving on costs.

Scaling a cluster using the Azure Portal
----------------------------------------
From the Settings on your HDInsight cluster with Presto, click Cluster Size.

Enter the new number of workers and click Save. In the case of scaling up, Presto will be automatically installed and configured on the new HDInsight Worker nodes so that there is nothing additional to be done. Once the nodes are up, they will start processing new queries.
