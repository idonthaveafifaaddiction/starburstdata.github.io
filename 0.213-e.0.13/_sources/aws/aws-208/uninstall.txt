Uninstalling Presto
===================

Deleting a Presto Cluster on the AWS CloudFormation Console
-----------------------------------------------------------

**1. Select the Stack**
	From the list of Presto clusters (CloudFormation stacks) within the AWS CloudFormation Console, select the cluster you intend to uninstall. Note that the cluster must currently be running in order to delete it.

**2. Actions Menu**
	Navigate to the Actions drop down menu and click “delete stack”.

**3. Confirm the Delete Action**
	When prompted with the option to confirm or cancel the delete request, click “Yes, Delete” to proceed with the uninstallation of your Presto cluster.

Once stack deletion has begun, you cannot terminate the process. The cluster proceeds to the ``DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`` state. After the cluster deletion is complete, the cluster will be in the ``DELETE_COMPLETE`` state. Clusters in the ``DELETE_COMPLETE`` state are not displayed in the AWS CloudFormation console by default. To display deleted clusters, you must change the stack view setting. Or If the delete failed, the cluster will be in the ``DELETE_FAILED`` state. 
	
For information on how to fix failed delete actions on the AWS CloudFormation Console, navigate to the “delete stack fails” section within the `AWS CloudFormation documentation`_.

Deleting a Presto Cluster in the AWS CLI
----------------------------------------
	
To delete a Presto cluster within the AWS CLI, you must run the AWS CloudFormation delete-stack command. This process requires the user to identify the name of the stack that they intend to delete. 

.. Note:: When you delete a Presto cluster, you delete the entire cluster and all of its resources. Moreover, you can not delete a cluster in which termination protection is enabled.

Reference the following example: 

.. code-block:: RST

	aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name myprestostack


Safeguarding Your Presto Cluster
--------------------------------

You can prevent your Presto cluster from being accidentally deleted by enabling termination protection. See `safeguarding your stacks`_.
