.. code-block:: RST

	show catalogs;
	show schemas in tpch;

**4. Write Query**

ODBC & JDBC Drivers
-------------------
The open source Presto JDBC driver can be used with Presto on AWS. This can be downloaded from Starburst’s download page.
Additionally, Starburst provides Enterprise ODBC and JDBC drivers, available for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms for its Enterprise customers.
Please refer to the following link for `both`_.

Presto WebUI and ODBC/JDBC Endpoint
-----------------------------------
To locate the DNS address of your cluster’s coordinator node, for your connection string, follow the steps below.

**1. CloudFormation Console**
	Navigate to the CloudFormation Console under “Management Tools” within the Services menu.

**2. Outputs**
	Select your "Stack Name" and click the associated tab labeled “Outputs”.

**3. Presto WebUI**
	Find and copy the “PrestoCoordinatorURL" key and enter the value into a web browser.

**4. ODBC/JDBC Endpoint**
	Find and copy the “PrestoCoordinatorURL" key and enter the value in the ODBC/JDBC connection string.

Note that because the Coordinator address is defined via a AWS Hosted Zone, then depending on whether this is a private Hosted Zone it is resolvable only within the same VPC which as the Starburst Presto cluster stack.
