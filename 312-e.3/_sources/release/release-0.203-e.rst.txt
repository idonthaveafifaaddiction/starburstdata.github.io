Release 0.203-e
===============

General changes
---------------

* Introduce cost-based plan optimizations.
* Replace ``distributed_join`` session property with ``join_distribution_type``.
* Replace ``reorder_joins`` session property with ``join_reordering_strategy``.
* Add support for ROLE management including CREATE ROLE, DROP ROLE, GRANT ROLE, REVOKE ROLE, SET ROLE, SHOW CURRENT ROLES, SHOW ROLES and SHOW ROLE GRANTS commands.
* Track execution statistics of AddExchanges and PredicatePushdown optimizer rules.
* Support prepared statements that are longer than 4K bytes.

Hive Connector changes
----------------------

* Implement ROLE management support.
* Allow partitions without files for bucketed tables (via hive.empty-bucketed-partitions.enabled).
* Allow multiple files per bucket for bucketed tables (via hive.multi-file-bucketing.enabled). There must be one or more files per bucket. File names must match the Hive naming convention.
* Allow reading incompletely bucketed tables with missing files (via hive.empty-bucketed-partitions.enabled).
* Respect the ``skip.footer.line.count`` Hive table property.

Security changes
----------------

* Secured internal cluster communication over HTTPS using Kerberos or LDAP authentication.

Data Types
----------
Release changes the semantics of the ``TIMESTAMP`` and ``TIME``
types to align with the SQL standard. See the following sections for details.

Note: This is still experimental work and subject to subsequent changes.
The new semantics is disabled by default but can be enabled using ``deprecated.legacy-timestamp`` config property
or ``legacy_timestamp`` session property.

**TIMESTAMP semantic changes**

Previously, the ``TIMESTAMP`` type described an instance in time in the Presto session's time zone.
Now, Presto treats ``TIMESTAMP`` values as a set of the following fields representing wall time:

 * ``YEAR OF ERA``
 * ``MONTH OF YEAR``
 * ``DAY OF MONTH``
 * ``HOUR OF DAY``
 * ``MINUTE OF HOUR``
 * ``SECOND OF MINUTE`` - as decimal with precision 3

For that reason, a ``TIMESTAMP`` value is not linked with the session time zone in any way until a time zone is needed explicitly,
such as when casting to a ``TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`` or ``TIME WITH TIME ZONE``.
In those cases, the time zone offset of the session time zone is applied, as specified in the SQL standard.

For various compatibility reasons, when casting from date/time type without a time zone to one with a time zone, a fixed time zone
is used as opposed to the named one that may be set for the session.

eg. with ``-Duser.timezone="Asia/Kathmandu"`` on CLI

 * Query: ``SELECT CAST(TIMESTAMP '2000-01-01 10:00' AS TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE);``
 * Previous result: ``2000-01-01 10:00:00.000 Asia/Kathmandu``
 * Current result: ``2000-01-01 10:00:00.000 +05:45``

**TIME semantic changes**

The ``TIME`` type was changed similarly to the ``TIMESTAMP`` type.

**TIME WITH TIME ZONE semantic changes**

Due to compatibility requirements, having ``TIME WITH TIME ZONE`` completely aligned with the SQL standard was not possible yet.
For that reason, when calculating the time zone offset for ``TIME WITH TIME ZONE``, the Starburst distribution of Presto uses
the session's start date and time.

This can be seen in queries using ``TIME WITH TIME ZONE`` in a time zone that has had time zone policy changes or uses DST.
eg. With session start time on 1 March 2017

 * Query: ``SELECT TIME '10:00:00 Asia/Kathmandu' AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'``
 * Previous result: ``04:30:00.000 UTC``
 * Current result: ``04:15:00.000 UTC``

**Time-related bug fixes**

 * The ``current_time`` and ``localtime`` functions were fixed to return the correct value for non-UTC timezones.
