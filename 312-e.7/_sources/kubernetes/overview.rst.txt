Overview of Presto on Kubernetes
================================

Releases & Software
-------------------

Presto 0.312-e
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starburst Presto on Kubernetes is based on version 312e. 312e includes many
additional features and patches to the prestosql/presto version 312.
Notably, Presto 312e, includes the state of the art cost based optimizer for fast query results.

For more information on Presto `312e`_, refer to our documentation.

.. _312e: http://docs.starburstdata.com/latest/release/release-312-e.html

Deployment Options
------------------

`Google Kubernetes Engine <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/>`_ is certified by Starburst to work with Presto on Kubernetes,
for more information on running Presto on Google Kubernetes Engine, refer to :doc:`gke`.
Additionally Starburst Presto on Kubernetes can be used on any modern Kubernetes cluster implementations (both on-prem and in the cloud).
It is also possible to run Presto Kubernetes on Minikube for testing or development purposes.

Presto Cloud Architecture
-------------------------

General Components and Descriptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starburst Presto on Kubernetes consists of various components and Kubernetes resources that form a Presto Kubernetes cluster.
The following terms describe each component of the Presto Kubernetes architecture in more detail:

**Presto Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition**

Presto Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) defines resources of Presto type
within a Kubernetes namespace. For more information on Kubernetes Custom Resources,
refer to `Custom Resources <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources>`_.

**Presto Kubernetes resources**

Presto Kubernetes resources are instances of Presto Kubernetes Custom Resource.
Each instance of a Presto Kubernetes resource represents a Presto cluster.
Presto Kubernetes resource contains various parameters that specify Presto, connector
and Kubernetes properties. For more information on Presto Kubernetes resource, refer
to :doc:`presto_resource`.

**Presto Operator**

Presto Operator is a Kubernetes Operator pod that orchestrates Presto clusters.
Presto Operator continuously monitors Presto Kubernetes resources.
Presto Operator will create or remove Presto clusters when
Presto Kubernetes resource is created or removed.
Any changes to existing Presto Kubernetes resource will be picked
up by the Presto Operator which will update the corresponding Presto cluster
accordingly. For more information on Kubernetes Operators, refer to
`Kubernetes Operators <https://coreos.com/operators/>`_.

**Presto service account**

The account used by Presto Operator to make Kubernetes API calls.

**Presto service role**

The role that is bound to Presto service account. The role must have enough
privileges to manage Presto clusters.

**Presto Coordinator**

A Presto pod that is responsible for parsing the SQL queries as well as
analyzing, planning, and scheduling their execution.
Presto Coordinator pods are part of Kubernetes Deployment that keeps
at most a single Presto Coordinator pod running at the same time.
Presto Coordinator pod will be automatically recreated on
Presto Coordinator failure or unresponsiveness thus providing
basic Presto high availability.

**Presto Worker**

Presto pods that are responsible for performing particular query tasks. Number of
Presto workers can be adjusted statically by specifying the ``worker.count`` property (see :doc:`presto_resource`)
or automatically via Kubernetes :doc:`hpa`.

**Presto Coordinator Service**

A Kubernetes `Service <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/>`_
that delegates requests to the Presto Coordinator pod. Presto Coordinator Service
is the frontend of a Presto cluster which accepts queries and exposes the
Presto Coordinator GUI.

**Presto Network Policy**

A Kubernetes `Network Policy <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/>`_
that only allows inbound traffic to Presto Worker pods from the Presto Coordinator pod.
Support for Kubernetes Network Policies might need to be enabled in your Kubernetes cluster.

**Metastore**

A Hive Metastore pod that is running when Presto cluster is configured to use an internal Metastore.

**PostgreSQL**

A PostgreSQL pod that is running when Presto cluster is configured to use
an internal Metastore with an internal ephemeral Metastore database.

Labels
^^^^^^

.. _labels:

All Presto Kubernetes components are labelled so that it's easy to write selectors
in order to match them. Those labels are:

* :code:`instance: CLUSTER_NAME_UUID` -- :code:`CLUSTER_NAME_UUID` is the cluster
  name with a unique suffix. :code:`CLUSTER_NAME_UUID` can be overridden
  via the :code:`nameOverride` :doc:`presto_resource` property.
* :code:`role: ROLE_NAME` -- :code:`ROLE_NAME` can be one of:

  * :code:`catalogs` -- specifies catalogs *ConfigMap*
  * :code:`configuration` -- specifies configuration *ConfigMap*
  * :code:`coordinator` -- specifies Presto Coordinator related components
  * :code:`worker` -- specifies Presto Worker related components
  * :code:`hive-metastore` -- specifies Hive Metastore related components
  * :code:`hive-postgresql` -- specifies PostgreSQL (for Hive Metastore) related components
  * :code:`prometheus-coordinator` -- specifies Prometheus metrics endpoint for Presto Coordinator
  * :code:`prometheus-worker` -- specifies Prometheus metrics endpoint for Presto Workers
