Power BI Driver
===============

The Power BI Driver can be used to connect Microsoft Power BI Desktop and
Microsoft Power BI Service to Starburst Enterprise Presto.

Contact Starburst support to receive the driver as a ``.mez`` file.

Prerequisite ODBC Driver
------------------------

The Power BI Driver requires the Starburst Enterprise Presto ODBC driver
detailed in :doc:`/installation/enterprise-drivers` to be installed.

Installation for Power BI Desktop
---------------------------------

In order to allow usage of the driver, you need to allow loading of extensions
without validation or warning in Power BI Desktop. Configure this in *File ->
Options* and *Settings -> Options -> Security -> Data Extensions*.

Next close Power BI and copy the ``.mez`` file into ``%USER%\Documents\Power BI
Desktop\Custom Connectors`` for each user. Create the directory, if it does not
exist.

Restart Power BI and you can locate *Starburst Presto* as a source in the Get
data dialog.

Connecting with Power BI Desktop
--------------------------------

The driver always tries to connect with an encrypted connection first. If you
are connecting without SSL/TLS, the connector offers the option to connect using
an unencrypted connection afterwards.

To use an  SSL/TLS encrypted connection to your Starburst Enterprise Presto
server, make sure the server’s certificate is added to the system trust store
(*Certificates -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities*) ​before connecting to
a SSL/TLS-enabled. The certificate can be added for the machine, or for each
user running the Power BI connector.  In many organizations this handled
automatically as part of the operating system and browser configuration.

Once added, connections work transparently to the user:

* Select *Starburst Enterprise Presto* as source in the *Get Data* dialog.
* Choose your *Data Connectivity* mode and proceed with *OK*.
* Continue with the desired authentication detailed below.
* After the connection is established, you can use the *Data Navigator* to
  browse catalogs, query data sources and more.

LDAP Authentication with Power BI Desktop
-----------------------------------------

If your Starburst Enterprise Presto server is configured to use LDAP
authentication, select *LDAP* in the authentication window when connecting to
Presto and provide your username and password credentials.

Kerberos Authentication with Power BI Desktop
---------------------------------------------

To use Kerberos authentication, Kerberos must be installed for the user and
initialized using ``kinit``, before using the driver. This establishes your user
credentials on the machine.

Select *Kerberos* in the authentication window, when connecting, and provide the
Kerberos *Service name*.

Connecting with Power BI Service
--------------------------------

Using the Power BI service, requires you to have the `on-premises data gateway
<https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/gateway/>`_ for Power BI installed on your
machine.

In addition, the gateway service account needs to have sufficient permissions to
access the ``Custom Connectors`` directory, ``C:\Users\<Name>\Documents\Power BI
Desktop\Custom Connectors`` inside your Power BI installation. 

Update the directory properties in the *Security - Advanced* tab. Add access
that grants *Basic Permissions - Full Control* to *Everyone / Authenticated
Users*. Alternatively, you can also create a new group and add the gateway
service account to a new group.

Update the value for *Load custom data connectors from folders* in the
*Connectors* configuration of the gateway to point at the folder in your Power
BI Desktop installation.

Login to Power BI Online and update the *Gateway Cluster Settings*. Enable the
setting *Allow user's custom data connector to refresh through this gateway
clusters*.

Now you can add a data source:

* Login to the Power BI service
* Navigate to Setting -> Manage gateways
* Select the gateway -> Add data source
* Set the *Data Source Type* to *Starburst Presto*
* Enter the corresponding host and port
* Set the authentication as desired
* Click *Add* to create the data source and begin using it

Limitations
-----------

* Self-signed certificate usage for TLS/SSL connections is not supported.
* Authentication type and field name customizations do not apply on Power BI
  Service. The following is the mapping of the Service field names to their
  Desktop counterparts:

  ==================  ======================
  Service Name        Desktop Name
  ==================  ======================
  Basic               LDAP
  Key                 Kerberos
  Key: Account Key    Kerberos: Service Name
  ==================  ======================
