Presto on Microsoft Azure
*************************

Microsoft Azure can be used in numerous ways to run Presto, and optionally the
related data sources and infrastructure in the cloud:

- Use :doc:`Mission Control</mission-control>` and the :doc:`Kubernetes support
  of Presto</kubernetes>` and run it on Azure Kubernetes Services.
- Install and run Presto on Azure compute instances leveraging the
  :doc:`installation of Presto from the archive</installation/deployment>`.
- Install and run Presto on Azure compute instances using the
  :doc:`RPM package</installation-rpm>`.
- Use Presto as part of your Azure HDInsight usage.

This chapter focuses on the HDInsight usage.
