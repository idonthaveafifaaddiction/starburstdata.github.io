Accessing the Presto Cluster
============================

Starburst Presto Application View
---------------------------------
From the HDInsight Settings, click Applications which will show the view with Presto listed as an installed application.

Clicking on the Portal link will open the Presto Web UI. Clicking on the row will display the Applications Properties view.

The view provides information such as the Name, Status, Webpage URLs, SSH Endpoint, and Description. There is a limitation in the HDInsight platform that does not allow Starburst to name the Webpages more descriptive. The first link will also open the same Presto Web UI as with the previous. The second link will open Superset.

Accessing the Presto Web UI
---------------------------
The Presto Web UI is running on the Azure HDInsight edge node at the URL:

``https://<cluster-name>-web.apps.azurehdinsight.net.``

Replace “cluster-name” with the actual name of your cluster. 


This will open a login for the username and password. You must enter the username and password of the HDInsight Cluster.

Connect to the Presto Edge Node via SSH
---------------------------------------
 
**1. Copy the SSH endpoint.**

The SSH endpoint is listed in the Application Properties view.

**2. Open a Terminal Window**

Open a terminal window to begin a command line.

**3. Establish a Connection**

To establish a connection to the master node, issue a command in your terminal. Using the example below, replace ``starburstpresto`` with the name of your HDInsight cluster. If you chose a different SSH user than the default, then use that username instead.

Reference the following example:

.. code-block:: RST

	ssh sshuser@Presto.starburstpresto-ssh.azurehdinsight.net

**4. Close**

When you have finished working with your Presto cluster, type the exit command to close the SSH connection.

Access Presto on HDInsight using on-prem clients
------------------------------------------------

By default, applications like Presto running on Azure HDInsight clusters cannot be accessed from on-premise network.
If you have Presto client tools installed on-premise you may want to set up Azure Virtual Network
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network, for accessing Presto deployed in HDInsight.

Another option will be to have the client tools deployed on the Presto Edge node. By default, you will have Presto CLI installed on
the :ref:`Presto Edge Node <azure-presto-edge-node>` at path ``/``.
