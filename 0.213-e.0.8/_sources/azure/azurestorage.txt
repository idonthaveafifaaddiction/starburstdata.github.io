Querying Azure Storage
======================
Presto for HDInsight can be configured to query Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). Azure Blobs are accessed via the Windows Azure Storage Blob (WASB). This layer is built on top of the HDFS APIs and is what allows for the separation of storage from the cluster. This is key to what allows you to scale Presto and HDInsight independently of storage.

If you choose Azure Blob Storage, it will be configured automatically for you. However, if you need to change it later, the following need to be specified in the ``hive.properties`` Presto configuration.

.. code-block:: RST

	hive.azure.wasb-storage-account=<account-name>
	hive.azure.wasb-access-key=<access-key>

If you choose to use ADLS, you need to add the following to your hive.properties Presto configuration:

.. code-block:: RST

	hive.azure.adl-client-id=<application-id>
	hive.azure.adl-credential=<key>
	hive.azure.adl-refresh-url=<token-endpoint>

Refer to the :doc:`Custom Configuration <configuration>` section for how to extend the default configurations.
