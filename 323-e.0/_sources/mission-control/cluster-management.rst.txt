Cluster Management
==================

.. contents:: :local:

Overview
--------

A cluster provides the resources for Presto to run queries against numerous
:ref:`data sources<mc-data-source>` for the Presto users.

Clusters define the number of workers and their configuration for the
JVM runtime system and others aspects, including the data sources. With Mission
Control the creation and management of these clusters is available via a simple
user interface.

The cluster management is suitable to create, update, and delete these
clusters. Any user can access the cluster source management by clicking on the
**Clusters** item in the left hand panel.

The cluster management view displays a grid of all existing clusters.

Press the + symbol on the bottom right corner to add a new cluster. The user
creating a cluster is assigned as the owner of the cluster.

Clicking on a cluster name, or using the **Edit** link in the actions drop down,
allows you to edit the data source.

To use the cluster, you have to ensure that you have added the :ref:`the
configured data sources<mc-data-source>`, which you want to expose to the users
of the particular cluster.

Cluster Properties

Clusters are defined by the following global properties:

Name:

Id:

  A unique identifier for the cluster.

State:

Data Sources

You can add and remove :ref:`configured data sources<mc-data-source>`. Click on
the *Choose* button and check the desired data sources.

The remaining configuration sections allow you to set up the parameters defining
the coordinator and the worker nodes, the network usage and exposure, and other
aspects.
