Data Source Management
======================

.. contents:: :local:

Overview
--------

Data sources define the connection of Presto to the various external databases
and other systems, that are queried by the Presto user. With Mission Control the
creation and management of these data sources is available via a simple user
interface.

The data source management is suitable to create, update, and delete these data
sources. Any user can access the data source management by clicking on the
**Data Sources** item in the left hand panel.

The data source management view displays a grid of all existing data sources.

Press the + symbol on the bottom right corner to add a new data source.

Clicking on a data source name, or using the **Edit** link in the actions drop
down, allows you to edit the data source.

As a next step you can :ref:`move on to create a cluster<mc-cluster>`, in which
the data source is used and available for Presto users to query against.

Data Source Properties
----------------------

Data sources are defined by the following properties:

Type:

  Defines the type of external data source to connect to. Type is :ref:`closely
  related to the connector<type-connector-mapping>` used to access the data in
  the external data source.

Name:

  The name of the data source. A well chosen name is important, since it details
  the data source to the user in Presto. For example, your data source is
  configured to access a specific database on a specific PostgreSQL server
  instance. Choosing a name ``postgresql`` is therefore not really sufficient.
  It can be more useful for your users to choose a name of
  ``postgresql-customerdb``. Potentially, if your users do not really have to
  know anything about the underlying database, it can also be appropriate to
  just use a name such as ``customerdb``.

Description:

  The description allows you to compose a short paragraph that provides more
  details about the data source than the name alone.

Configuration properties:

  The configuration properties field is used to provide all the necessary
  details about the configuration of the connector and the data source to
  Presto. The supported properties differ for each connector and are identical
  to the properties used in the data source configuration file, documented with
  the connector and typically located in ``etc/catalog``.

Data Source Types and Connectors
--------------------------------

Data source types define the connector Presto uses for the specific data
source. The connector in turn, defines the configuration properties to use.

Refer to the following table to determine what connector configuration
properties are used for a specific data source Type:
