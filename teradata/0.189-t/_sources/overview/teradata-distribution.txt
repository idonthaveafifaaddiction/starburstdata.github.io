===============================
Teradata Distribution of Presto
===============================
Teradata's distribution of Presto remains as close to the PrestoDB distribution as possible. It is is always based on a PrestoDB release and may contain additional features specific to the Teradata Distribution of Presto.

Versioning
----------
We follow the general concept  from the article on `semver.org <http://semver.org>`_ The general idea is to keep our versioning like this:
FBMajor.FBMinor.FBPatch-t.TDMinor.TDPatch

For example: 0.189-t.0.1 indicates Teradata’s distribution of Presto was based on PrestoDB’s distribution at 0.189. We add the –t suffix to denote the Teradata distribution. And the 0.1 is the Teradata minor release and Teradata patch number.
