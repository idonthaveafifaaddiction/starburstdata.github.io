Limitations
***********

**Teradata Presto ODBC/JDBC Drivers**

* The Teradata JDBC driver does not support batch queries.
* ``SET ROLE`` functionality is not supported on ODBC versions <= 1.1.8  and JDBC versions <= 1.0.14.
* If called through JDBC, executeUpdate does not return the count of rows inserted.

----

**File Format**

Teradata only supports data stored in the following formats:

 * Text files
 * ORC
 * RCFILE
 * PARQUET

----

**SQL/DML/DDL Limitations**

 * ``NATURAL JOIN`` is not supported
 * ``LIMIT ALL`` and ``OFFSET`` are not supported
 * For ``INSERT INTO ... VALUES``, the data types must be exact, i.e. must use ``date '2015-01-01'`` for ``date``, and you must supply a value for every column.

----

**Hive Connector Limitations**


**TIMESTAMP limitations**

Presto supports a granularity of milliseconds for the ``TIMESTAMP`` datatype, while Hive
supports microseconds.

**INSERT INTO ... SELECT limitations**

INSERT INTO creates unreadable data (unreadable both by Hive and Presto) if a Hive table has a schema for which Presto
only interprets some of the columns (e.g. due to unsupported data types).  This is because the generated file on HDFS
will not match the Hive table schema.

**Hive Transactions**

The Hive connector does not support Hive ACID tables.
