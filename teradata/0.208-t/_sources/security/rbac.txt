Role Based Access Control
=========================

Using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Presto, one can manage authorization
for large number of users and objects through the entire enterprise. Using
SQL Standard Based authorization is one way to achieve this. For an overview of
this authorization option, see :ref:`hive-sql-standard-based-authorization`.

Apache Sentry provides Role-Based Access Control for services
that interact with Hadoop data such as Presto.

In RBAC there is the notion of Roles and Privileges. Roles are authorization entities for
which authorization privileges are granted to. Privileges can be granted to zero, one, or
more roles. Users belong to one or more groups.

When configured with Apache Sentry, Presto will enforce the privileges required to access data.
Unlike sql-standard based authorization, Presto does not manage granting privileges to roles when integrated with 
Apache Sentry. It only enforces ones set by Apache Sentry.
Presto relies on an underlying mechanism such as Kerberos to authenticate the user who belongs
to zero or more user groups. These groups are commonly mapped from LDAP/AD but can also be configured
to be mapped from Operating System groups.

For more information on managing privileges refer to the Cloudera documentation for Apache Sentry:

ROLES in Presto
===============

Setting a role makes that role active and the user only has those privileges applied to that role.
By default all assigned roles are active and the user has the combined privileges of these roles.

See :doc:`/sql/set-role` and :doc:`/sql/show-roles` for additional information.

Column Level Authorization
==========================

Presto will enforce column level privileges granted to roles. For example, if a user is only granted
access to a subset of table columns, they will only be able to query from these columns.
If they execute an SQL statement that refers to other columns, the query will fail with an error.
