Installing Presto Admin
=======================

Currently presto-admin is supported on following platforms:
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.x
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.x
 - CentOS equivalent to RHEL (Community ENTerprise Operating System)
 - Oracle Linux 7
 - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) SP4 11
 - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) SP3 12

Presto Admin is packaged as an offline installer --
``prestoadmin-<version>-offline.tar.gz`` -- and as an online
installer -- ``prestoadmin-<version>-online.tar.gz``.

The offline installer includes most of the dependencies for
``presto-admin``, so it can be used on a cluster with limited Internet
connectivity. For the supported systems the supported way
of installing presto-admin is though offline installer.

Prerequisites list for offline presto-admin installer per platform
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6/CentOS 6

   - `Python 2.6 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_.
   - tar
   - libffi
   - openssl
   - openssh
   - openssh-clients
   - openssh-server
   - sudo (when presto-admin connects as non-root user via SSH)

 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7/Oracle Linux 7

   - `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_.
   - tar
   - libffi
   - openssl
   - openssh
   - openssh-clients
   - openssh-server
   - net-tools
   - sudo (when presto-admin connects as non-root user via SSH)

 - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SP4 11

   - `Python 2.6 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_.
   - tar
   - libffi43
   - openssh
   - gawk
   - aaa_base
   - glibc-locale
   - glibc-i18ndata
   - python-xml
   - sudo (when presto-admin connects as non-root user via SSH)

 - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SP3 12

   - `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_.
   - tar
   - libffi4
   - openssh
   - aaa_base
   - glibc-locale
   - glibc-i18ndata
   - python-xml
   - sudo (when presto-admin connects as non-root user via SSH)

Note: depending on particular installation some of those requirements
could already have been satisfied.

The online installer downloads the dependencies when you run
``./install-prestoadmin.sh``. You must use the online installer for
installation of Presto on Amazon EMR and for use on any operating
system not listed above. If you are using presto-admin on an
unsupported operating system, there may be operating system
dependencies beyond the installation process, and presto-admin may not
work.

To install ``presto-admin``:

1. Copy the installer ``prestoadmin-<version>-offline.tar.gz`` to the
location where you want ``presto-admin`` to run.
Note that ``presto-admin`` does not have to be on the same node(s)
where Presto will run, though it does need to have SSH access to all
of the nodes in the cluster.

.. NOTE::
     For Amazon EMR, use the online installer instead of the offline installer.

2. Extract and run the installation script from within the ``prestoadmin`` directory.
::

 $ tar xvf prestoadmin-<version>-offline.tar.gz
 $ cd prestoadmin
 $ ./install-prestoadmin.sh

The installation script will create a ``presto-admin-install`` directory and an
executable ``presto-admin`` script. By default, the ``presto-admin`` config and log
directory locations are configured to be ``~/.prestoadmin`` and ``~/.prestoadmin/log``,
respectively.  This can be changed by modifying the environment variables,
PRESTO_ADMIN_CONFIG_DIR and PRESTO_ADMIN_LOG_DIR. The installation script will also create
the directories pointed to by PRESTO_ADMIN_CONFIG_DIR and PRESTO_ADMIN_LOG_DIR. If those
directories already exist, the installation script will not erase their contents.

3. Verify that ``presto-admin`` was installed properly by running the following
command:
::

 $ ./presto-admin --help

Please note that you should only run one ``presto-admin`` command on your
cluster at a time.
