  property.

* Support retrieving table and column statistics. The statistics can be inspected with :doc:`/sql/show-stats` and are taken into account in
  :doc:`/optimizer/cost-based-optimizations`.
* Fix incorrect insertion of data when the target table has an unsupported type.

MySQL Connector Changes
-----------------------

* Support retrieving table and column statistics. The statistics can be inspected with :doc:`/sql/show-stats` and are taken into account in
  :doc:`/optimizer/cost-based-optimizations`.
* Fix incorrect insertion of data when the target table has an unsupported type.

Redshift Connector Changes
--------------------------

* Fix incorrect insertion of data when the target table has an unsupported type.

JDBC based Connectors Changes
-----------------------------

* Add metadata cache that is configured with ``metadata.cache-ttl`` and ``metadata.cache-missing``.
  By default caching is disabled (equivalent to ``metadata.cache-ttl=0s`` and ``metadata.cache-missing=false``).
* Collect JMX metrics about metadata information collection and connection usage.

Elasticsearch Connector Changes
-------------------------------
* Add support for datetimes exposed as numbers in Elasticsearch
* Handle mixed-case columns in Elasticsearch

Update 1
========

General Changes
---------------

* Fix incorrect query results when query contains ``LEFT JOIN`` over ``UNNEST``.
* Fix accounting of semantic analysis time when queued queries are cancelled.
* Support user groups in file-based resource group selectors.
* Support JSON-style lists in addition to regular expressions in file-based resource group selectors.
* Improve performance when processing columns of ``map`` type.

Hive Connector Changes
----------------------

* Fix a CDH 5.x metastore compatibility issue resulting in the metastore discarding stats computed with :doc:`/sql/analyze`.
* Fix a CDH 5.x metastore compatibility issue resulting in failure when inserting data into, or analyzing a table with ``date`` columns.
* Fix listing user's roles and applicable privileges when roles form a diamond inheritance structure.
* Improve concurrency when updating table or partition statistics.

Teradata Connector Changes
--------------------------

* Support unbounded varchar type in ``CREATE TABLE`` statement.
* Support UTF-8 characters.

Teradata Table Operator Connector Changes
-----------------------------------------

* Support unbounded varchar type in ``CREATE TABLE`` statement.
* Support UTF-8 characters.

Oracle Connector Changes
------------------------

* Add connection pooling support. Pooling is enabled by default as a performance improvement and requires Oracle's ``ucp.jar``.
  See :doc:`/connector/oracle` for details.

Update 2
========

General Changes
---------------

* Support LDAP referrals in LDAP password authenticator

Update 3
========

General Changes
---------------

* Support narrowing type coercions for insert queries.
* Add ``error_type`` and ``error_code`` columns to ``system.runtime.queries``.

Hive Connector Changes
----------------------

* Fix incorrect data returned when using S3 Select on uncompressed files. In our testing, S3 Select
  was apparently returning incorrect results when reading uncompressed files, so S3 Select is disabled
  for uncompressed files.
* Fix incorrect data returned when using S3 Select on a table with ``skip.header.line.count`` or
  ``skip.footer.line.count`` property. S3 Select API does not support skipping footers or more than one
  line of a header.  In our testing, S3 Select was apparently sometimes returning incorrect results when
  reading a compressed file with header skipping, so S3 Select is disabled when any of these table
  properties is set to non-zero value.

Snowflake Connector Changes
---------------------------

* Improve performance of distributed snowflake connector.

BigQuery Connector Changes
---------------------------

* Update supported BigQuery JDBC driver.

Kafka Connector Changes
-----------------------

* Support authentication with secured Kafka services.

* Add best-effort compatibility with older JDBC drivers. This can be enabled with
  ``generic-jdbc.experimental.jdbc-version-compatibility.enabled`` configuration property.

Security Changes
----------------
* Fail LDAP authentication if username contains any special LDAP characters

Hive Connector Changes

  ``hive.collect-column-statistics-on-write`` is enabled and one of the inserted
  ``REAL`` or ``DOUBLE`` values is infinite or ``NaN``.
* Fix occasional ``CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT`` or ``INSERT INTO ... SELECT`` query failure when reading
  from Hive table ("IllegalStateException: Invalid query id ... while current query is [Optional.empty]").
* Add explicit support for conversion from Parquet decimal column type to Presto integer
  column types.
* Add validation of Parquet decimal column type scale.
* Improve ``information_schema`` query latency when Hive views execution is enabled.
* Improve performance for queries containing ``IN`` predicates over bucketing columns.

Teradata Connector Changes
--------------------------

* Support ``NUMBER`` Teradata data type without specified precision and scale.
  See Teradata type mapping :ref:`Teradata_type_mapping_configuration` section for more details.
