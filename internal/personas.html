      <h1>Personas used for documentation</h1>
<p>There are three primary audiences we write for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presto administrators</li>
<li>Data engineers</li>
<li>Data analysts</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a single, secondary audience: “Data leaders.” As this persona is
largely a check writer for our purposes (VP, CDO, CIO), and does not actually
use SEP any differently than the primary personas, they are not treated
separately here.</p>
<p>This document describes these audiences as personas - fictional amalgamations -
that you can empathize with and solve problems on behalf of. In practice,
product personas are given names, faces and backgrounds to aid in discussing
their needs as if they were real people, representative of our customers.</p>
<h2>Primary documentation personas</h2>
<h3>Presto Administrators</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/internal/persona-admin-Art.png" alt="Art Administrator" 
             height="200" width="auto" /></br>
    </td>
    <td>
      Ada Administrator</br>
      Late career</br>
      BSc in computer science</br></br>
      <p>Art Administrator is responsible for XYZ, Inc's Presto cluster. He was
      an SRE for the data team for years, and switched roles to platform 
      engineering after leading the SREs for a bit. Art really cares about 
      scalability and reliability, especially since XYZ has super aggressive 
      SLAs both on data landing times and of course availability. Art works 
      closely with his colleagues in IT to ensure that his systems adhere to 
      XYZ's strict access policies and support audit requirements.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr  style="background-color: white;">
    <td><img src="/assets/img/internal/persona-admin-Ada.png" alt="Ada Administrator" 
             height="200" width="auto" />
    </td>
    <td>
      Ada Administrator</br>
      Late career</br>
      BSc in computer science</br></br>
      <p>Ada Administrator is responsible for both Acme Corp's Presto and 
      Postgres clusters. Ada was a DBA from early to mid-career, and it fell to
      her at Acme to figure out the HDFS ecosystem when it came along. Now she 
      builds and maintains big data clusters for a living. Dana cares a lot 
      about the using right data platform for the data.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When you write, design and build for Art and Ada, here are some of the skill
sets you can expect them to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building and maintaining scalable data platform architectures to support the
ingest, storage and querying of large heterogenous datasets.</li>
<li>Creating and monitoring cluster health metrics to ensure optimal performance
and reduce any downtime.</li>
<li>Writing clean production ready code (in Java, Go etc.) with a strong focus on
quality, scalability and high performance.</li>
<li>Using and building scalable asynchronous REST API’s.</li>
<li>Working with cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.</li>
<li>Implementing and working with persistence technologies like AWS S3, HDFS,
Kafka, ElasticSearch etc.</li>
<li>Designing for data integrity and security through all environments as well as
the data lifecycle.</li>
<li>Partnering with data engineers to enable automated self-service pipelines
using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).</li>
<li>Partnering with data engineers to design and improvement schemas, data lake
and data warehouse solutions in collaboration with stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Art’s &amp; Ada’s pain points, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorting through an overload of information to master complex data platforms</li>
<li>Ensuring data platforms can scale to demand and with growth</li>
<li>Architecting solutions that can provide disaster recovery and business
continuity for complex, critical data systems, in conjunction with IT
stakeholders</li>
<li>Managing budgets and licensing cycles for multiple (and multiplying), massive
enterprise-scale software vendors, bandwidth and hardware leases</li>
<li>Constantly tackling inherently complex tasks</li>
<li>Worried about infrastructure scale and budget considerations</li>
<li>Doing more with less, or at least the same, team size</li>
<li>Implementing data governance requirements for all data systems</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Engineers</h3>
<table width=80%>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/internal/persona-deng-Donna.png" alt="Donna Data Engineer" 
             height="200" width="auto" /></br>
    </td>
    <td>
      Donna Data Engineer</br>
      Mid-career</br>
      BSc in computer engineering</br></br>
      <p>Donna Data Engineer is responsible for designing performant data 
      sources that can answer a broad range of business questions at XYZ, Inc.
      Donna found her way to data engineering through internships in college; it
      felt like a good blend between the technical chops required for 
      programming jobs, and the big picture, organizational nature of data that
      she is naturally drawn to. As part of her job, she must understand what
      data is currently available from what sources, and what new data is needed
      to fill in any gaps, and work with stakeholders to source that new data,
      be it from third parties or through new log entries, message streams or 
      product endpoints. Donna works pretty closely with Data analysts and 
      scientist, and tries to anticipate their needs in order to keep up with 
      burgeoning data demands.</p>

    </td>
    <td>
      Daniel Data Engineer</br>
      Mid-career</br>
      BSc in computer science</br></br>
      <p>Daniel Data Engineer is responsible for delivering data to data 
      analysts and data scientists at Acme Corp. Up until a few years ago, 
      this mostly entailed writing complex ETL in frameworks such as Informatica
      and Alteryx. Over the last few years, he's worked mostly in a python-based
      frameworks such as Airflow and Bonobo as well as diving into Apache Spark.
      Daniel really cares about data landing times, because him and his 
      coworkers hear from PagerDuty way more than they would like to. </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

analytics</li>
<li>Identifying, designing, and implementing internal process improvements such as
automating manual processes, optimizing data delivery for greater scalability</li>
<li>Creating data tools for analysts and data scientists</li>
<li>Build data integrations between various 3rd party systems such as Salesforce
and Workday</li>

<li>Managing SLAs for data pipelines in environments where the data growth rate
constantly increases, as well as the complexity of data pipelines</li>
<li>Sussing out detailed data requirements from folks with a wide range of data
knowledge</li>
<li>Long, brittle pipelines</li>
<li>Productionalizing non-performant analyst queries</li>

</ul>
<h3>Data Analysts and Scientists</h3>
<p>Data analysts and scientists will approach Presto in very similar ways. However,
their backgrounds and skill sets are different, so we will separate those out.
Their pain points will be treated together.</p>
<table width=80%>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/internal/persona-danalyst-Ben.png" alt="Ben Data Analyst" 
             height="200" width="auto" /></br>
    </td>
    <td>
      Ben Data Analyst</br>
      Early career</br>
      BSc in physics, currently working on MBA</br></br>
      <p>Ben is a Business Analyst. He's responsible for delivering 
      visualizations and reports to ensure that his leadership is making 
      well-informed, data-driven decisions. Ben cares very deeply that not only
      are the right questions being asked (and answered), but that the right 
      data is being used to answer the questions. With the wealth of data
      available, it can be easy to overlook and misuse data. The quality of 
      Ben's work ultimately rests on the quality and reliability of the data he
      uses, so Ben keeps good working relationships with his data engineering 
      team and often communicates discrepancies and SLAs issues to them. Ben has
      some really great SQL chops and is often able to prototype a new data 
      source he needs productionalized by data engineers. Ben feels that he has
      just the right combination of technical skills and business acumen.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When you write, design and build for Ben, here are some of the skill
sets you can expect him to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reasonable level of skill with SQL, with some knowledge of more advanced
queries</li>
<li>Limited programming skills</li>
<li>Tells stories with data</li>
<li>Expert with data visualization tools</li>
<li>Excellent spreadsheet skills, including some modelling</li>
<li>A good ability to detect and articulate issues with data, even if he cannot
remedy them or trace the cause</li>
</ul>

    </td>
    <td>
      Bree Data Scientist</br>
      Early career</br>
      PhD in statistics</br></br>
      <p>Bree is a data scientist. She's responsible for creating data models 
      and that forecast and describe the business. Bree worries about the impact
      of seasonality on sales, and feels compelled to deliver models that 
      reflect that impact with a high degree of accuracy. Bree feels like she 
      brings the answers to "Why?" and "How?" to the table. Her machine learning
      models help her find the levers that the business can pull - the "how," 
      and her models account for why the business behaved as it did, or will. 
      She feels more like an academic than an engineer, and is very proud of her
      scientific approach to business. Her digital sales data knowledge is 
      robust, and her reputation as an SME ensures that she has a robust stream
      of opportunities in her field.</p>
    </td>

<li>Reasonable programming skills</li>
<li>Expert in statistical methods and/or machine learning</li>
<li>Some understanding of code repositories</li>
<li>Competence with data visualization tools</li>
<li>A good ability to detect and articulate issues with data, even if they cannot
remedy them or trace the cause</li>
</ul>
<p>Bree’s and Ben’s pain points, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having to retrofit tools onto multiple data sources</li>
<li>Long waits for ETL to deliver useable data</li>
<li>Can’t dive into data quality issues</li>
<li>Data engineers sometimes kill their queries because of resource contention</li>
<li>Complex, periodic reports and models are often delayed past due dates</li>
