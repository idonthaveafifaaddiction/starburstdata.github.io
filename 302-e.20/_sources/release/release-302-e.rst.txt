  properties file.

Update 14
=========

JDBC based Connectors Changes

-----------

* Limit the size of ``http-request.log`` to 100MB by default.

JDBC based Connectors Changes
-----------------------------

* Fail query when accessing unsupported column. **This is backward incompatible** change,
  user may restore previous behaviour by using ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy=IGNORE`` connector configuration
  property or by setting ``unsupported_type_handling_strategy`` catalog session property to ``IGNORE``.
* Add option to convert unsupported column values to unbounded ``VARCHAR``.
  This could be achieved by using ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy=CONVERT_TO_VARCHAR`` connector configuration

  property). This value will be used when mapping Oracle ``NUMBER`` data type (without precision and scale) to Presto
  ``DECIMAL``.
* Introduce ``oracle.number.rounding-mode`` configuration property (and matching ``number_rounding_mode`` session
  property). This value will be used for rounding fractional part of Oracle ``NUMBER`` data type (without precision and scale)
  value to Presto ``DECIMAL`` where needed scale exceeds configured (with ``oracle.number.default-scale``) Presto ``DECIMAL`` scale.

Security Changes
----------------

* Improve authenticated user authorization.

Update 20
=========

General Changes
---------------

* Fix failure when querying ``/v1/resourceGroupState`` endpoint for non-existing resource group.
* Improve configuration file parsing. Trailing whitespace in configuration values will is now ignored
  just as the leading whitespace used to be. Parsing of boolean values is now strict, anything other than
  ``true`` or ``false`` (case-insensitively) is now considered an error. Previously anything other than
  ``true`` was considered a false value.
* Limit total size of ``http-request.log.*.gz`` files. This is controlled by ``http-server.log.max-history
  * http-server.log.max-size``, which is 1500MB by default.
* Limit total size of ``server.log.*.gz`` files. This is controlled by ``log.max-history * log.max-size``,
  which is 1500MB by default.

Hive Connector Changes
----------------------

* Add support for custom S3 filesystems.
* Allow to to specify only ``hive.metastore-cache-ttl`` when enabling Hive Metastore caching (without setting
  ``hive.metastore-refresh-interval``, which is disabled by default).
* Allow using several Hive catalogs with different configuration (with different Kerberos authentication setup).


JDBC based Connectors Changes
-----------------------------

* Restoring default behaviour for column with unsupported types. Such columns will be ignored.
  User may configure to fail such queries by using ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy=FAIL`` connector configuration
  property or by setting ``unsupported_type_handling_strategy`` catalog session property to ``FAIL``.
