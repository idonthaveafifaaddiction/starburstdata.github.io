Querying Presto
===============

The Presto Coordinator pod is reachable via the Kubernetes Service.
By default, the service is only available within the Kubernetes
Cluster at :code:`http://presto-coordinator-service-CLUSTER_NAME_UUID.NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local:8080`,
where :code:`NAMESPACE` is the Kubernetes namespace where the given Presto cluster
is deployed and :code:`CLUSTER_NAME_UUID` is the unique service name.

You can adjust the endpoint name using :code:`service.name` parameter.
Please refer to :ref:`Service properties <service>` for more information.

CLI
---

**1. Launch Presto CLI pod in interactive mode**
	In your console, type the following command to launch Presto CLI pod. Your cursor will skip to the next line,
	prefixed with a Presto prompt: ``presto >``.

.. code-block:: RST

	kubectl run presto-cli --rm -i --tty --image IMAGE_REPOSITORY/starburstdata/presto -- presto-cli \
	 --server http://presto-coordinator-service-CLUSTER_NAME_UUID.NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local:8080

where :code:`IMAGE_REPOSITORY` is your Docker registry address (if present).

**2. Show Catalogs and Schemas**
	View your catalogs and schemas by running the following commands.
	Note: replace ``tpch`` with your desired catalog.

.. code-block:: RST

	show catalogs;
	show schemas in tpch;

**3. Write a Query**
	Type your SQL query into the Presto CLI. For reference, view the SQL SELECT statement below.

.. code-block:: RST

	select * from tpch.sf1.nation;

**4. Run Query**
	Press <Enter> to execute your query. Query progress is displayed live in the Presto CLI console.

**5. View Query Results**
	When Presto finishes processing the query, you will be presented with the results of your query within the Presto CLI console.
