Overview
--------

Mission Control provides the user powerful access to your Presto
deployment. Access restrictions to allow only authenticated and authorized
users are important for successful usage.

Authentication
--------------

Mission Control supports three authentication systems:

- built-in user management ``INTERNAL``
- external LDAP providers such as Active Directory ``LDAP``
- Google authentication ``GOOGLE``

The user authentication systems are configured in the ``authentication.type``
property. The default is ``INTERNAL``. One or more types in the desired order,
separated by commas, are supported. Leaving the value empty disables
authentication, and is not recommended.

Internal Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The internal authentication uses data stored in the backend database for access
control and can be controlled with :doc:`the user management
section<./user-management>`.

LDAP Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LDAP authentication for Mission Control has to be configured using the
``ldap.*`` properties in the :ref:`general config file<mc-configuration>`.

Google Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use Google authentication, if your Mission Control server is available
at a URL using a full domain name, such as ``example.com``.

The following steps describe how to activate this authentication in your Google
cloud configuration.

#. Go to your Google Cloud console at https://console.cloud.google.com.
#. Select your project.
#. Access the APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen.
#. Select application type. Use internal app so that only users within your
   organization can authenticate.
#. Add your domain name to the authorized domains list.
#. Save and access APIs & Services > Credentials.
#. Create credentials selecting OAuth client ID.
#. Select *Web application*.
#. Provide a name such as *Mission Control* and the full URL to Mission Control.
#. Use the provided client id and client secret for the parameters
   ``authentication.google.client-id`` and ``authentication.google.secret`` in
   your :ref:`Mission Control general config file<mc-configuration>`.
#. Add the domain name of the Google accounts to allow, such as ``example.com``
   with ``authentication.google.hosted-domain`` in the config file.
#. Restart Mission Control.

Now you can sign into Mission Control using your Google account.

Authorization
-------------

Mission Control distinguishes between users with and without administrative
rights. Only administrative users have access to manage other users and to edit
all data sources and clusters.

Only the ``INTERNAL`` authentication system allows users to have administrative
rights. We therefore suggest to use other authentication types in combination
with the internal authentication.

Data sources have no authorization restrictions.

Clusters can only be edited by the creator, who are automatically assigned as
the owner of the cluster, and administrators.
