Overview
--------

Mission Control includes the ``admin`` user out of the box. It has full
administrative rights and is suitable to perform all operations.

In many cases, different people use Mission Control to set up different data
sources and clusters. In this scenario, it is best practice to create separate
user accounts to track access, manage access rights and ensure correct ownership
of any created data sources and clusters.

The user management is suitable to create, update and delete these user
accounts. Any user, with administrative rights, can access the user management
by clicking on the **Users** item in the left hand panel, after :doc:`logging
into Mission Control <./getting-started>`.

The users management view displays a list of all existing users.

Press the + symbol on the bottom right corner to add a new user.

Clicking on a user allows you to edit the user.

The actions item on the list includes links to delete a user and to reset the
password.
