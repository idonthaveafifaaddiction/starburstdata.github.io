SET SESSION
===========

Synopsis
--------

.. code-block:: none

    SET SESSION name = expression
    SET SESSION catalog.name = expression

Description
-----------

Set a session property value or a catalog session property.

Catalog session properties use the name of a catalog as a prefix in front of a
session property supported by a connector.

Examples
--------

The following example enables optimized hash generation.

.. code-block:: sql

    SET SESSION optimize_hash_generation = true;

An example of the usage of catalog session properties is the :doc:`Accumulo
connector </connector/accumulo>`, which supports a property named
``optimize_locality_enabled``. If you use the connector in a catalog properties
file named ``keyvaluestore.properties``, you need to use the following command
to set the catalog session property.

.. code-block:: sql

    SET SESSION keyvaluestore.optimize_locality_enabled = false;

This catalog session property does not apply to any other catalog, even if it
also uses the Accumulo connector.

Another example is the setting the ``optimized_reader_enabled`` for the catalog
called ``hive``, from the filename ``hive.properties``::

    SET SESSION hive.optimized_reader_enabled = true;
