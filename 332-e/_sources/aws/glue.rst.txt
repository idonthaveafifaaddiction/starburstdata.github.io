AWS Glue Support
================

AWS Glue is a supported metadata catalog for Presto. It is intended to be used
as a alternative to the Hive Metastore with the Presto Hive plugin to work with
your S3 data.

AWS Glue with Starburst Enterprise Presto AMI
---------------------------------------------

When you deploy a Starburst Enterprise Presto AMI from the AWS Marketplace, you
need to configure the Hive connector to use Glue. The minimal setup is to do the
following on all Presto nodes:

1. create a ``/etc/presto/catalogs/glue.properties`` file with at least the
contents below:

  .. code-block:: properties

    connector.name=hive-hadoop2
    hive.metastore=glue

You should add all other Hive Connector specific properties for your use case.
See :doc:`/connector/hive` and :doc:`/connector/hive-security` for more details.

2. restart Presto with:

  .. code-block:: none

    sudo service presto restart

AWS Glue with Starburst Enterprise Presto CloudFormation Template
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When using the Starburst CloudFormation template in AWS, you can leverage Glue
by simply choosing ``AWS Glue Data Catalog`` in ``MetastoreType`` field of the
Stack creation form (``Presto Configuration`` section)

Starburst Enterprise Presto with AWS Glue Usage
-----------------------------------------------

When configured as above, the Glue catalog will be available as the ``hive``
connector from within Presto CLI or any other Presto connection. As usual
remember to specify the location of the data on S3. Either for the entire schema
or on the table level. For example to create a schema ``foo`` in Glue, with the
S3 base directory (root folder for per table subdirectories) pointing to the
root of ``my-bucket`` S3 bucket, you would write::

    CREATE SCHEMA hive.foo
    WITH (location = 's3://my-bucket/')

You can also create and edit the schema and tables directly from AWS Glue. In
AWS Glue terminology the schema is called “database”.

Prerequisites
-------------

Both the AMI and CloudFormation approach mentioned above require the Presto
instances to have permissions to access both S3 and Glue AWS services.

**When using Starburst Enterprise Presto via our CloudFormation template by
default you do not need to provide anything, the template will create all
necessary resources automatically.**

If however you need to provide your own IAM Instance Profile for the Presto
instances (``IamInstanceProfile`` field in the Stack creation form) please
consult the :ref:`aws_security_prereq_nodes` section. Same applies when
launching the AMI manually, make sure you choose an IAM Role that satisfies the
requirements.

Table and Column Statistics Support
-----------------------------------

With ``hive.metastore.glue.column-statistics-enabled`` set to ``true`` (default)
table and column statistics will be collected for Glue tables and partitions.
Such statistics are stored in JSON format as Glue table and partition
parameters. See also :doc:`/sql/analyze`.

Known limitations of AWS Glue support
-------------------------------------

There are a couple Presto features that are not yet supported with the Glue
catalog:

* When column is renamed its statistics are not preserved. Therefore the table  
  needs to be reanalyzed.
* Renaming tables from within AWS Glue is not supported.
* Partition values containing quotes and apostrophes are not supported (for 
  example, ``PARTITION (owner="Doe's"``).
* Using :doc:`Hive authorization</connector/hive-security>` is not supported.
