Accessing the Presto Cluster
============================

Connect to your Presto Cluster via SSH
--------------------------------------

**1. Preliminary Steps**

  In order to access your Presto cluster, you must obtain the IP address of the
  Coordinator and the file name of your .pem file.

  To locate the Coordinator IP address:

  * **CloudFormation Console:**
    Navigate to the CloudFormation Console under “Management Tools” within the Services menu.

  * **Outputs:**
    Select your "Stack Name" and click the associated tab labeled “Outputs”.

  * **SSH Access:**
    Find and copy the “PrestoSSH” key's value.

**2. Open a Terminal Window**
  Open a terminal window to begin a command line.

**3. Establish a Connection**

  To establish a connection to the coordinator, issue a command in your
  terminal. Using the example below, replace ``coordinator-ip`` with the IP
  address of your Coordinator and replace ``mykeypair.pem`` with the location
  and file name of your ``.pem`` file.

  Reference the following example:

.. code-block:: none

  ssh ec2-user@coordinator-ip -i ~/.ssh/mykeypair.pem

**4. Close**

  When you have finished working with your Presto cluster, type the exit command to close the SSH connection.

.. code-block:: none

  exit
