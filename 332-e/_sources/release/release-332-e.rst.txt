Breaking Changes
----------------

* The internal cluster communication in earlier Starburst Enterprise Presto
  supports using Kerberos for authentication. This functionality has been
  removed in favor of automatically securing internal cluster communication.
  Find more details in :doc:`/security/internal-communication`.
* The Starburst BigQuery connector is replaced by the open source BigQuery
  connector contributed by the community. The new connector is more feature-rich
  and performant. Users of the old connector need to change their catalog files
  to adapt to the usage of the new connector and its configuration properties,
  documented in :doc:`/connector/bigquery`.
* The usage of ``users`` and ``groups`` in :doc:`resource groups as selector
  rule properties </admin/resource-groups>` and used for :doc:`catalog rules as
  part of the built-in system access controls
  </security/built-in-system-access-control>` is deprecated. Replace any usage
  with lists and regular expressions in the ``user`` and ``group`` fields. For
  example, change ``users: ["abc", "def", "xyz"]`` to ``user:  "abc|def|xyz"``.
* The ``DECODE`` function has been removed from the :doc:`/functions/oracle`
  plugin. Users can change their SQL statements to achieve the same behavior 
  with the :ref:`use of a CASE statement <case_expression>`.
* The Starburst Secrets support using a Java keystore file containing any 
  secrets is deprecated and replaced with the secrets support from Presto. More
  information can be found in :doc:`/security/secrets`.
* The :doc:`query audit </security/audit>` feature changed to use a different
  configuration file and properties.

General Changes
---------------

* The preferred runtime for Presto servers changes from Java 8 to Java 11. While
  using Java 11 is not a hard requirement at this stage, we strongly suggest to
  update to gain performance improvements and other benefits. Java 11 is planned
  as a hard requirement for the next release. More information can be found in
  :doc:`/installation/software-requirements`.

Security Changes
----------------

* Simplified TLS/SSL usage for :doc:`cluster internal communication
  </security/internal-communication>`.
