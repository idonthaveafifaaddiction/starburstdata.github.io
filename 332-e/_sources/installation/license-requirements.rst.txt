===================================

As mentioned in the :doc:`overview </overview>` a license for Starburst
Enterprise Presto includes support and enables numerous features.

After receiving a signed license file from Starburst, it needs to be stored
on all Presto nodes in your clusters.

The license file needs to be named ``starburstdata.license`` and located within
the Presto installation directory as ``etc/starburstdata.license``, or whatever
directory is configured as the etc directory with the launcher script. In case
of the :doc:`rpm archive </installation/rpm>` this path is
``/etc/presto/starburstdata.license``.

Users of the AWS CFT for Starburst Enterprise Presto can provide the license
information as part of the configuration in the AWS console.

Kubernetes users need to create a secret in the cluster with ``kubectl``. The
filename of the secret is required to be ``signed.license``, so ensure to rename
the file before running the command, if necessary.

.. code-block:: none

  kubectl create secret generic presto-license --from-file signed.license

The name of the secret needs to be configured with the ``licenseSecretName``
property in the :doc:`Kubernetes resource </kubernetes/presto_resource>`.
