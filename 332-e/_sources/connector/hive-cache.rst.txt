===================
Hive Object Caching
===================

.. TBD Migrate to prestosql

Querying object storage with the Hive connector is a very common use case for
Presto, that often involves the transfer of large amounts of data. The objects
are retrieved from HDFS, or any other supported object storage, by multiple
workers and processed on these workers.

Repeated queries with different parameters, or even different queries from
different users, often access, and therefore transfer, the same objects. The
Hive object caching can provide significant performance benefits, by avoiding
the repeated network transfers and instead accessing copies of the objects from
a local cache.

.. warning::
  Hive object caching is currently available as beta release only. Please work
  with the Starburst support team, if you are planning to use this feature in
  production.

Architecture
------------

The Hive object caching provides a read-through cache. After first retrieval
from storage by any query, objects are cached in the local cache storage on the
workers. Objects are cached on local storage of each worker and managed by a
bookkeeper component. The cache chunks are 1MB in size and are well suited for
ORC or Parquet format objects.

Configuration
-------------

The caching feature is part of the :doc:`Hive connector <./hive>` and can be
activated in the catalog properties file:

.. code-block:: none

    connector.name=hive-hadoop2
    hive.cache.enabled=true

The cache operates on the coordinator and all workers accessing the object
storage. The used networking ports for the managing bookkeeper and the data
transfer, by default 8898 and 8899, need to be available.
