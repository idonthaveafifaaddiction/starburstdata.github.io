IBM Cloud Object Storage Support for the Hive Connector
=======================================================

The :doc:`Hive connector </connector/sb-hive>` can be configured to support
accessing `IBM Cloud Object Storage COS
<https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage>`_.

In order to use COS, you need to configure a catalog file to use the Hive
connector. For example, create a file ``etc/catalog/ibm-cos.properties`` and
specify the path to the COS service config file with the
``hive.cos.service-config`` property.

.. code-block:: properties

    connector.name=hive-hadoop2
    hive.cos.service-config=etc/catalog/cos-service.properties

The service configuration file contains the access and secret keys, as well as
the endpoints for one or multiple COS services:

.. code-block:: properties

    service1.access-key=<your-access-key1>
    service1.secret-key=<your-secret-key1>
    service1.endpoint=<endpoint1>
    service2.access-key=<your-access-key2>
    service2.secret-key=<your-secret-key2>
    service2.endpoint=<endpoint2>

The endpoints property is optional. ``service1`` and ``service2`` are
placeholders for unique COS service names. The granularity for providing access
credentials is at the COS service level.
