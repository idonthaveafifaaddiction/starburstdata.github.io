===================
Release 0.208-e.0.1
===================

General changes
---------------

* Introduce cost-based plan optimizations.
* Add support for ROLE management including CREATE ROLE, DROP ROLE, GRANT ROLE, REVOKE ROLE, SET ROLE, SHOW CURRENT ROLES, SHOW ROLES and SHOW ROLE GRANTS commands.
* Support prepared statements that are longer than 4K bytes.
* Fix timeout issue when getting stats on large number of partitions.
* Improve statistics estimation for filter expressions
* Fix data loss when writing bucketed sorted tables. Partitions would be missing arbitrary rows if any of the temporary files for a bucket had the same size. The numRows partition property contained the correct number of rows and can be used to detect if this occurred.
* Update docs with memory-related configs introduced in 0.201
* Fix ``EXPLAIN ANALYZE`` for index join


Hive Connector changes
----------------------

* Implement ROLE management support.
* Allow partitions without files for bucketed tables (via hive.empty-bucketed-partitions.enabled).
* Allow multiple files per bucket for bucketed tables (via hive.multi-file-bucketing.enabled). There must be one or more files per bucket. File names must match the Hive naming convention.
* Allow reading incompletely bucketed tables with missing files (via hive.empty-bucketed-partitions.enabled).
* Add support for Azure Blob Storage
* Add support for Azure Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)
* Fix multi-file buckets when Presto does the insert
* Support creating Avro tables with a custom schema using the ``avro_schema_url``
  table property.
* Support backward compatible Avro schema evolution.
* Fix reading when Hadoop KMS is enabled


MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redshift, and SQL Server Changes
—————————————————————————-
* Allow for predicate pushdown of ``DECIMAL`` and ``CHAR`` predicates


Kafka Connector Changes
-----------------------

* Support Avro formatted Kafka messages.
* Support backward compatible Avro schema evolution.


Security changes

* Secured internal cluster communication over HTTPS using Kerberos or LDAP authentication.
* Add support for cross-realm Kerberos authentication

===================
Release 0.208-e.0.2
===================

Base JDBC changes
-----------------

* Do not push down predicate for not supported domain.


===================
Release 0.208-e.0.3
===================

General changes
---------------

* Flip the default value of "deprecated.legacy-char-to-varchar-coercion" property to "true".
  So that CHAR to VARCHAR implicit coercion is allowed (and not the opposite).
  This returns the code to the state from Presto version 0.206.
* Fix unaccounted memory usage in broadcast join in source stage.

Hive
----
* Fix table statistics retrieval for column with single distinct value.
