* Fix Avro schema loading when ``SERDEPROPERTIES`` set.
* Support partitioned Avro table with very long column type definition.
* Support tables located in HDFS encryption zones managed with Hadoop KMS.

  :doc:`/optimizer/cost-based-optimizations`.

PostgreSQL Connector Changes
----------------------------

* Support user impersonation.
* Support retrieving table and column statistics. The statistics can be inspected with :doc:`/sql/show-stats` and are taken into account in

* Improve authenticated user authorization.

RPM Changes
-----------

* Limit the size of ``http-request.log`` to 100MB by default.

Hive Connector Changes
----------------------

* Optimize checking object privileges for Sentry.
  Especially queries like ``SHOW TABLES`` on schemas with thousands of tables should be now much faster.

JDBC based Connectors Changes
-----------------------------

* Fail query when accessing unsupported column. **This is backward incompatible** change,
  user may restore previous behaviour by using ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy=IGNORE`` connector configuration
  property or by setting ``unsupported_type_handling_strategy`` catalog session property to ``IGNORE``.
* Add option to convert unsupported column values to unbounded ``VARCHAR``.
  This could be achieved by using ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy=CONVERT_TO_VARCHAR`` connector configuration
  property or by setting ``unsupported_type_handling_strategy`` catalog session property to ``CONVERT_TO_VARCHAR``.

Oracle Connector Changes
------------------------

  property). This value will be used when mapping Oracle ``NUMBER`` data type (without precision and scale) to Presto
  ``DECIMAL``.
* Introduce ``oracle.number.rounding-mode`` configuration property (and matching ``number_rounding_mode`` session
  property). This value will be used for rounding fractional part of Oracle ``NUMBER`` data type (without precision and scale)
  value to Presto ``DECIMAL`` where needed scale exceeds configured (with ``oracle.number.default-scale``) Presto ``DECIMAL`` scale.
* Push down ``LIMIT`` clause to Oracle Database.

* Support data transfer encryption.
* Support Kerberos authentication.
* Support ``NUMBER`` (without precision and scale) data format.

JDBC based Connectors Changes
-----------------------------

* Restoring default behaviour for column with unsupported types. Such columns will be ignored.
  User may configure to fail such queries by using ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy=FAIL`` connector configuration
  property or by setting ``unsupported_type_handling_strategy`` catalog session property to ``FAIL``.

Generic JDBC Connector Changes
------------------------------

* Support user impersonation.

Update 6
========

  just as the leading whitespace used to be. Parsing of boolean values is now strict, anything other than
  ``true`` or ``false`` (case-insensitively) is now considered an error. Previously anything other than
  ``true`` was considered a false value.
* Limit total size of ``http-request.log.*.gz`` files. This is controlled by ``http-server.log.max-history
  * http-server.log.max-size``, which is 1500MB by default.
* Limit total size of ``server.log.*.gz`` files. This is controlled by ``log.max-history * log.max-size``,
  which is 1500MB by default.

  Especially queries like ``SHOW TABLES`` on schemas with thousands of tables should be now much faster.
* Improve hive query execution when view was created with tables without schema specified.
