Release 0.213-e
===============

Update 0.1
==========

General Changes
---------------

* Fix bug where the CLI throws a vague error ``Query gone(server restarted?)`` instead of actual ``Exception`` message.
* Support prepared statements that are longer than 4K bytes. 
* Cost based optimization for partial aggregation that conditionally depending on cost redistributes data before partial aggregation.
* Add security audit logging.
* Add CloudWatch Agent compatible logger.
* Add ANALYZE SQL command.
* Improve planning and query performance for queries with ``TINYINT``, ``SMALLINT`` and ``VARBINARY`` literals.
* Fix issue where queries containing distributed ``ORDER BY`` and aggregation could sometimes fail to make progress when data was spilled.
* Make top N row number optimization work in some cases when columns are pruned.
* Add session property ``optimize-top-n-row-number`` and configuration property ``optimizer.optimize-top-n-row-number`` to toggle the top N row number optimization.
* Split reporting of raw input data and processed input data for source operators.
* Correctly report processed input data for source stages in EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
* Don't report raw input data for Values, Local Exchange and Local Merge Sort operators.
* Add experimental support for :doc:`/admin/spill` for OrderBy. The feature needs to be explicitly enabled. 
* Add experimental support for :doc:`/admin/spill` for WindowOperator. The feature needs to be explicitly enabled. 
* Add Generic JDBC connector.
* Print join enumeration stats in explain analyze.
* Flip the default value of ``deprecated.legacy-char-to-varchar-coercion`` property to ``true``, so that ``CHAR`` to ``VARCHAR`` implicit coersion is allowed (and not the opposite). This returns the code to the state from Presto version 0.206.
* Fix memory leak for failed queries.

Security Changes
----------------

* The LDAP properties ``internal-communication.authentication.ldap.user`` and ``internal-communication.authentication.ldap.password`` are no longer supported. If the :doc:`LDAP</security/ldap>` authentication is enabled along with HTTPS for internal communication, then for successful communication between nodes you need to also enable SSL client certificate or Kerberos or JWT authentication.
* Support refreshing of ``FileBasedAccessControl`` and ``FileBasedSystemAccessControl`` with an optional property ``security.refresh-period``.
* Support LDAP with anonymous bind disabled

Hive Connector Changes
----------------------

* Implement ROLE management support.
* Allow partitions without files for bucketed tables (via ``hive.empty-bucketed-partitions.enabled``).
* Allow multiple files per bucket for bucketed tables (via ``hive.multi-file-bucketing.enabled``). There must be one or more files per bucket. File names must match the Hive naming convention.
* Allow reading incompletely bucketed tables with missing files (via ``hive.empty-bucketed-partitions.enabled``).
* Add support for Azure Blob Storage
* Add support for Azure Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)
* Add Hive metastore API recording tool for remote debugging purposes.
* Support CSV table storage format.
* Support Apache Ranger authorization (requires licence).
* Support Apache Sentry authorization (requires licence).
* Add support for column statistics in Glue.
* Support predicate pushdown for DATE type with Parquet.
* Support tables located in HDFS encryption zones managed with Hadoop KMS.
* Fix query failure when querying partitioned Avro table with very long column type definition.
* Support Avro tables with ``avro.schema.url`` in kerberized HDFS.

  if temporary staging directory should be used (whenever possible) for write operations.
* Add ``hive.temporary-staging-directory-location`` configuration property and matching
  ``hive.temporary_staging_directory_location`` session property to control
  the path of temporary staging directory for write operations.
  ``${USER}`` placeholder can be used to select different location for each user.
* Add ``hive.s3.upload-acl-type`` configuration property to specify the type of ACL to use while uploading files to S3.
* Add ``textfile_field_separator`` and ``textfile_field_separator_escape`` table properties to
