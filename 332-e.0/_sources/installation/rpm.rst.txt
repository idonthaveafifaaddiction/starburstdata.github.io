RPM Package and Presto Admin
============================

.. TBD Migrate to prestosql, and include content from https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-server-rpm there

RPM Package
-----------

Presto is available in RPM Package Manager (RPM) format. The package can be used
on various Linux distribution such as CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and
others.

The rpm package is available on `the Maven Central Repository <https://
repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/prestosql/presto-server-rpm/>`_. You can
download the rpm for the desired version and then install it with the rpm
command.

After installing Presto from the RPM, you can manage the Presto server with the
service command:

.. code-block:: none

  service presto [start|stop|restart|status]

The rpm package places the various files used by Presto in accordance to the
Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. This differs from the default installation
of Presto with the tar.gz, where all folders are in the installation directory.
For example, configuration files are by default located in the ``etc`` folder
within the installation directory. The rpm package installation however uses
``/etc/presto``. More details are available with the `rpm package source
<https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-server-rpm>`_.

Starburst Enterprise Presto is also available in RPM format.

Presto Admin
------------

Presto Admin is a tool for installing and managing Presto on a cluster. It uses
the rpm package and provides easy-to-use commands to:

* Install and uninstall Presto across your cluster
* Configure your Presto cluster
* Start and stop the Presto servers
* Gather status and log information from your Presto cluster

For a detailed explanation of all of the commands and their options, see:
