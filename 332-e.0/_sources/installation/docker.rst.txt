Docker Container
================

It is possible to run Presto in a Docker container for initial exploration and
testing, as well as for deployments in Kubernetes. The docker images contain a
full Presto distribution, including all connectors and other features, as well
as the Presto CLI.

The following Docker images are available:

* `prestosql/presto <https://hub.docker.com/r/prestosql/presto>`_ for Presto
* `starburstdata/presto <https://hub.docker.com/r/starburstdata/presto>`_ for
  Starburst Enterprise Presto

Out of the box these containers provides a single node cluster with the
following catalogs configured:

* :doc:`blackhole </connector/blackhole>`
* :doc:`jmx </connector/jmx>`
* :doc:`memory</connector/memory>`
* :doc:`tpcds </connector/tpcds>`
* :doc:`tpch </connector/tpch>`
* :doc:`system</connector/system>`

The containers can be deployed as a full cluster by mounting in configuration.

Getting Started
---------------

You can run the container locally, ensuring to publish port 8080 of the
coordinator:

.. code-block:: none

    docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 --name presto starburstdata/presto

When Presto is started, you can start the :doc:`Presto CLI </installation/cli>`
on the container:

.. code-block:: none

    docker exec -it presto presto-cli

The :doc:`Presto Web UI </admin/web-interface>` is started on the container and
available at `localhost:8080 <http://localhost:8080/>`_.
