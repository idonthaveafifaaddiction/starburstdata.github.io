Query Audit
===========

Presto can log and keep an audit trail about query executions. It logs a
timestamp value, the initiating user, the query ID and the SQL statement. Log
entries are stored in textual format in log files that are automatically
compressed and rotated at the end of a day.

.. note::
  An alternative to the query audit feature is the more powerful
  :doc:`./event-logger`.

Query audit logging is implemented as a :doc:`event listener
</develop/event-listener>` and can be enabled by creating a configuration file
called ``etc/event-listener.properties`` with the following properties.
