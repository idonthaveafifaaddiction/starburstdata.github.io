Starburst Teradata Parallel Direct Connector
============================================

The Teradata Parallel Direct Connector is an alternative connector for Teradata
databases.

Compared to the :doc:`sb-teradata`, it requires more advanced configuration and
is capable of achieving higher performance. It supports all use cases of the
Teradata connector, and adds greatly improved performance for ``SELECT``
queries.

.. contents::
  :local:

The connector is composed of components running on Presto, and others running on
Teradata. All components participate in every transmission. A transmission
includes all data transfer related to a single table scan.

The connector uses JDBC as a control channel to schedule the query in Teradata.
Any ``SELECT`` statement run with JDBC is passed to a Teradata Table Operator,
which then uses the custom transmitters to pass the data over HTTP to the Presto
controller and receivers:

Presto

    Controller
        The controller starts and manages all transmissions. It runs on the
        Presto coordinator and distributes work to the receivers, and provides
        status information to the transmitters.

    Receivers
        The receivers connect to the transmitters and receive data from Teradata
        from the transmitters. They run on the Presto workers and are managed by
        the controller.

Teradata

    Table Operator and JDBC Driver
        The table operator and JDBC driver read the data from the Teradata
        storage.

    Transmitters
        The transmitters send the data for each table operator invocation on
        Teradata to the receivers on Presto.

Follow the documentation below to start using the connector:

Presto Controller and Receiver Installation
-------------------------------------------

The Teradata Parallel Direct connector needs to be configured in a catalog
properties file. e.g. ``myteradatadb.properties``, using the connector name
``teradata-parallel-direct``.

.. code-block:: none

    connector.name=teradata-parallel-direct
    connection-url=jdbc:teradata://HOST
    connection-user=USERNAME
    connection-password=PASSWORD
    teradata-parallel-direct.table-operator.name=some_schema.presto_table_operator
    teradata-parallel-direct.http.port=9000
    teradata-parallel-direct.http.host=hostname.accessible.from.teradata.instance

Besides the connector name, you need to provide the JDBC connection parameters
and the relevant JAR files in the ``teradata`` plugin directory, as discussed in
:doc:`sb-teradata`. Additionally you need to configure the parameters for the
connector specifying the table operator name, and the HTTP port and host of the
Presto coordinator node.

Further tweaking can be done with the following parameters:

``teradata-parallel-direct.receiver.buffer.size`` in ``catalog.properties``, or
``receiver_buffer_size`` in catalog session properties:

    Determines the buffer size per each Presto worker. This buffer is available
    per table scan, so a single query joining three tables uses three buffers.
    Default value is 32MB.

``teradata-parallel-direct.transmitter.buffer.size`` in ``catalog.properties``,
or ``transmitter_buffer_size`` in catalog session properties:

    Determines the buffer size for each Teradata transmitter per table operator
    UDF invocation. This buffer is available per table operator, so a single
    query joining three tables uses three buffers. Default value is 32MB.

``teradata-parallel-direct.transmitter.threads.count`` in
``catalog.properties``, or ``transmitter_threads_count`` in catalog session
properties:

    Number of dedicated threads used for the data transfer. If it is set to 0,
    data transfer is handled by the UDF thread. Default value is 0.

    Having more dedicated threads for transfer result in better performance,
    until network is saturated or data is not produced fast enough. The threads
    are used per single table scan, so setting the count too high may cause
    resource related issues, especially with concurrent queries and with
    multiple table scans.

``teradata-parallel-direct.parcel.size`` in ``catalog.properties``, or
``parcel_size`` in catalog session properties:

    The size of the data packets sent to the Presto receivers. The last packet
    may be smaller. Defaults to 2MB. Parcel size should not be higher than the
    buffer size. If you are using N number of dedicated threads for the
    transmitters, then you should use at least ``2*N*stork.parcel.size`` for
    transmitter buffer.

``teradata-parallel-direct.compression.enabled`` in ``catalog.propertes``, or
``compression_enabled`` in catalog session properties:

    Determines if transmission data is compressed. Defaults to ``false``.

``teradata-parallel-direct.splits-per-worker`` in ``catalog.propertes``, or
``splits_per_worker`` in catalog session properties:

    Determines how many splits each Presto worker receives. This determines the
    maximum concurrency level on Presto. Defaults to 16, identical to the
    ``task.concurrency`` of the Presto server.

Aside from Teradata specific options, it is recommended to use JDBC connection
configuration, configured in the catalog properties file, to cache the Teradata
metadata on Presto and improve query performance.

.. code-block:: none

    metadata.cache-ttl=10m
    metadata.cache-missing=true
    statistics.cache-ttl=10m
    statistics.cache-missing=true


Encryption
^^^^^^^^^^

The connector can encrypt all data transmissions and use HTTPS. Add the details
for the Java keystore file to use in the Presto server config.

.. code-block:: none

    teradata-parallel-direct.https.keystore.path=mykekstore.jks
    teradata-parallel-direct.https.keystore.password=123456

Presto automatically distributes the keystore to the controller, the receivers,
the transmitters and the table operator.

Kerberos Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The connector supports Kerberos-based authentication with the following
configuration:

.. code-block:: none

    teradata.authentication.type=KERBEROS
    teradata.kerberos.client.principal=test@TESTING-KRB.STARBURSTDATA.COM
    teradata.kerberos.client.keytab=krb/client/test.keytab

With this configuration the user ``example@example.com``, defined in the
principal property, is used to connect to the database, and the related Kerberos
service ticket is located in the ``example.keytab`` file.

Kerberos Credential Passthrough
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The connector can be configured to pass through Kerberos credentials,
received by the Presto server, to the Teradata database.

Configure Kerberos and the Presto server, following the instructions in
:doc:`/security/credential-passthrough`.

Configure the connector to pass through the credentials from the
server to the database:

.. code-block:: properties

    teradata.authentication.type=PASS_THROUGH

Now any database access via Presto is subject to the data access restrictions
and permissions of the user supplied via Kerberos.

Teradata Table Operator Installation
------------------------------------

Prerequistes:

- Contact Starburst Support to receive the required JAR file,
  ``presto-table-operator.jar``.
- Teradata instance is up and running.
- Teradata user with sufficient access rights to install JAR and create user
  defined functions UDF

    .. code-block:: SQL

        GRANT CREATE EXTERNAL PROCEDURE ON syslib TO your_user WITH GRANT OPTION
        GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE ON sqlj.install_jar TO your_user WITH GRANT OPTION
        GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE ON sqlj.remove_jar TO your_user WITH GRANT OPTION
        GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE ON sqlj.replace_jar TO your_user WITH GRANT OPTION

JAR Installation:

Install the JAR located in ``JARPATH`` on the Teradata server, and create the
table operator UDF using BTEQ or a JDBC-connected tool. Ensure a short path to
the JAR file is used since only up to 64 character length for the path is
supported.

.. code-block:: none

    CALL sqlj.install_jar('SJ!/presto/table/operator/jar/JARPATH',’presto',0)
    REPLACE FUNCTION presto_table_operator() 
	    RETURNS TABLE VARYING USING FUNCTION session_contract 
	    LANGUAGE JAVA NO SQL PARAMETER STYLE SQLTABLE EXTERNAL 
	    NAME 'presto:com.starburstdata.teradata.PrestoTableOperator.execute'

No Teradata restart is needed for the changes to take effect.

Each user that connects to Teradata from Presto needs to be granted sufficient
access:

.. code-block:: SQL

    GRANT EXECUTE ON SPECIFIC FUNCTION test.presto_table_operator TO your_user

Alternatively access to table operator UDF can be granted via ROLE 

.. code-block:: none

    CREATE ROLE presto_table_operator_users;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON SPECIFIC FUNCTION test.presto_table_operator TO presto_table_operator_users;
    GRANT presto_table_operator_users TO your_user;

This also requires to set the role for any impersonated user, this could be
achieved with the below in the catalog file:

.. code-block:: none

    teradata.impersonation-role=presto_table_operator_users

Uninstallation:

.. code-block:: none

    DROP FUNCTION presto_table_operator
    CALL sqlj.remove_jar(‘presto’',0)

Upgrades: 

It is recommended for upgrade to install the Presto table operator under a
different name. The UDF function should also use a different name. That way it
is possible to have different Presto table operator versions installed at the
same time and an upgrade process does not affect the currently working system.
