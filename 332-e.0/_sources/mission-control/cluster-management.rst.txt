Overview
--------

A cluster provides the resources for Presto to run queries against numerous
:doc:`data sources<./data-source-management>` for the Presto
users.

Clusters define the number of workers and their configuration for the
JVM runtime system and others aspects, including the data sources. With Mission
Control the creation and management of these clusters is available via a simple
user interface.

The cluster management is suitable to create, update, and delete these
clusters. Any user can access the cluster source management by clicking on the
**Clusters** item in the left hand panel.

The cluster management view displays a grid of all existing clusters.

Press the + symbol on the bottom right corner to add a new cluster. The user
creating a cluster is assigned as the owner of the cluster.

Clicking on a cluster name, or using the **Edit** link in the actions drop down,
allows you to edit the cluster.

To use the cluster, you have to ensure that you have added the :doc:`the
configured data sources<./data-source-management>`, which you want to expose to the users
of the particular cluster.

The cluster management view shows the following details for each cluster:

Name:
  The user visible name of the cluster.

Owner:
  The user who created the cluster and therefore is considered the owner,
  detailed in :doc:`the security section <./security>`.

State:
  The operational state of the cluster. The view includes a play icon to start
  the cluster, or a stop button to shut it down. In addition a display for the
  number of workers is included, which includes functionality to scale the
  number of workers up or down.

Created at:
  The datetime of the initial cluster creation.


Cluster Configuration
---------------------

You can create and edit a cluster with the help of a multiple-page form wizard.
In create mode, you can navigate between steps with the **Previous** and
**Next** buttons. In edit mode, you can click on any step name to navigate to
it.

The forms focus on specific aspects about the cluster: 


Data Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data sources form allows you to configure the name of the cluster and add
and remove :doc:`configured data sources<./data-source-management>`.

Presto Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Presto configuration section allows you to configure all Presto
configuration values including global settings and coordinator and worker
setups.


Network Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The network configuration form is used to define all network aspects of the
deployment platform of EC2 or K8s, Presto cluster,  and access to it.

Kubernetes Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Kubernetes configuration is only available when running Mission Control on
Kubernetes as detailed in :doc:`the documentation about installing Mission
Control <./installation>`.

EC2 Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EC2 configuration is only available when deploying Mission Control to AWS as
detailed in :doc:`the documentation about installing Mission Control
<./installation>`.
