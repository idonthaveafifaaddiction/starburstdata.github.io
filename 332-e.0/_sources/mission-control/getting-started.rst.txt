First Login
-----------

After a successful :doc:`installation of Mission Control<./installation>`, you
have the URL of the server running it available from your deployment system.

Navigate to the URL of the server, e.g. ``http://mc.example.com:5041/`` and you
see the Mission Control login screen.

Use the default ``admin`` username with the password ``admin`` at first login.
You are forced to change the password to a new value.

After successful login you are presented with the Mission Control home screen.

The left hand navigation provides access to the home screen itself, as well as
:doc:`./data-source-management`, :doc:`./cluster-management` and
:doc:`./user-management`.

The top, right hand corner of the UI contains buttons to read the documentation,
access your user profile, and log out of Mission Control.

Next Steps
----------

Once you have successfully logged in, you can start with :doc:`setting up your
data sources<./data-source-management>` and then use them in the :doc:`clusters
you configure and start up<./cluster-management>`.

User Profile
------------

The user profile displays your user properties and allows you to change them.
More information about the properties can be found in the
:doc:`./user-management` documentation.
