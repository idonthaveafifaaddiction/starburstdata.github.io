Getting Started: A Quick Guide to Presto on Kubernetes
======================================================

Follow along with the below sections to quickly and easily navigate Starburst
Enterprise Presto on Kubernetes.

Prerequisites & Overview
------------------------

It is required that you are familiar with Kubernetes. Please refer to `kubernetes.io <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/>`_
for more information.
To familiarize yourself with specific elements of Starburst Enterprise Presto on Kubernetes, see the
:doc:`prerequisites` and :doc:`overview` sections of the Starburst documentation.

Deploy
------

Starburst Enterprise Presto can be deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine as well as any other
modern Kubernetes cluster (both on-prem and in the cloud). It is also possible
to run Presto Kubernetes on Minikube for testing purposes. For more details
how to deploy Presto on Google Kubernetes Engine, refer to :doc:`gke`.

Starburst Enterprise Presto on Kubernetes can be installed from DockerHub. For more details,
refer to :doc:`online_deploy`.

Starburst Enterprise Presto on Kubernetes can be installed using an offline installation package.
The package contains installation instructions, Kubernetes resource YAMLs and
Docker images used by the Presto cluster.

Customize
---------
Starburst Kubernetes integration allows adding a user-defined bootstrap script to the Presto Kubernetes pods.
This additional bootstrap script is executed on the Presto nodes
(coordinators and workers) upon node startup. Refer to :ref:`k8s_custom_bootstrap` for details.

If the additional bootstrap script mechanism is insufficient,
you can further customize Docker images used by Starburst Enterprise Presto on Kubernetes.
This allows you to to extend Presto with additional features, which
are not supported by default. For more details, refer to :ref:`k8s_custom_image`.

Query
-----

Once your Presto cluster has been created, it's time to query. Our :doc:`query`
section guides you through the process of accessing and querying your cluster with a CLI client.
