Integration with CloudWatch Logs
================================

Starburst's CloudFormation template automatically integrates with CloudWatch
Logs. Logs from Presto nodes are uploaded to log streams in
``/starburstdata/presto/STACK_NAME`` log group. Additionally, log files are
still stored and rotated on nodes themselves. Log stream names are of format
``STREAM-ROLE-INSTANCEID`` where:

* ``ROLE`` is either ``coordinator`` or ``worker``
* ``INSTANCEID`` is an instance ID designated by AWS

``STREAM`` can be one of:

* ``presto`` stream contains Presto server logs
* ``autoconfiguration`` stream contains Starburst auto-configuration script logs
* ``security`` stream contains query and user information for queries that were 
  issued to coordinator (see :doc:`/security/audit`)
* ``graceful-scaledown`` stream contains Starburst graceful scale down handling 
  script logs (there is a separate stream for each worker instance)
* ``ha-heartbeat`` stream contains Starburst HA heartbeat script logs (there is 
  a separate stream for each worker instance)
