Accessing the Presto Cluster
============================

Connect to your Presto Cluster via SSH
--------------------------------------

**1. Preliminary Steps**
	In order to access your Presto cluster, you must obtain the public DNS name of your cluster and the file name of your .pem file. 
	
	To locate the public DNS:
	
	* 	**CloudFormation Console:**
		Navigate to the CloudFormation Console under “Management Tools” within the Services menu. 


	* 	**Outputs:**
		Select your "Stack Name" and click the associated tab labeled “Outputs”.

	* 	**Public SSH Access:**
		Find and copy the “Public Presto SSH” value.

**2. Open a Terminal Window**
	Open a terminal window to begin a command line.

**3. Establish a Connection**
	To establish a connection to the master node, issue a command in your terminal. Using the example below, replace ec2-##-###-###-##.regioncode.compute.amazonaws.com with the public DNS name of your cluster and replace mykeypair.pem with the location and file name of your .pem file.

	Reference the following example:

.. code-block:: RST

	ssh ec2-user@ec2-##-###-###-##.regioncode.compute.amazonaws.com -i ~/.ssh/mykeypair.pem 

**4. Close**
	When you have finished working with your Presto cluster, type the exit command to close the SSH connection.

.. code-block:: RST

	exit
